Topic: TikTok - how does TikTokâ€™s data mining to improve its algorithm impact its users addiction to their platform 

## [Frontiers in Psychology Paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.932805)

**Why is this matter important?**
- The platform is huge and still growing
- Frontiers paper considers the algorithm the most advanced 
- The target audience is young adults and adolescents
  - 06-17 (31.59%)
  - 18-24 (30.14%)
  - 25-30 (20.85%)
  - 31-35 (8.66%)
  - 35+ (8.76%)
- The native and easily absorbed nature of young people 

**What does most research on the topic of social media addition fail to account for?**
  > The role of users' personal perception outside of psychological mechanisms (dopamine release)

**What does this study do differently?**
  > examines the effects of TikTok technical environment factors (information and system quality) and the impact this has on adolescents' inner perception  
  > adopts an extended version of the SOR model based on environmental psychology

**What is the SOR model?**
  - SOR Model: Stimulus Organism Response model
  - Proposes that **environmental stimulants** (S) work in conjunction to affect a **users'** (O) internal state to illicit some **response** (R)
  - **Stimulus:** Information/system quality  
      - **Information quality** refers to content and is measured in conciseness, subscription and usefulness. 
      - **System quality** is the application/algorithm and is measured in flexibility, integration, ease of use, and response time
  - **Organism:** The users' internal state of perception, feelings, and thinking composed of cognition and emotion 
    - **Cognition:** time distortion
    - **Emotion:** enjoyment/concentration/boredom/etc
      - These were components of the online ***flow experience*** *(The inner feeling of enjoyment that encourages further participation)*
  - **Response:** Depicted as access/avoidance attitude or behavior generated from external environment (S) or interally from the user (O)

**(According to the paper) What was data was explicitly said to be mined?**
  > - Login method
  > - Netowrk-associated personal info
  > - content of likes

**Keywords/phrases**
- Entertainment spiral
- Closed Loop relationship: between the addiciton and algorithm optimization
- **Flow Experience:** an inner feeling of enjoyment, concentration, time distortion
  - Also found in the context of online gaming
- The (S) in SOR could refer to the layout or physical interface used (phone/tablet/desktop)

- Labels it fastest growing social network
- 100 Automated bots used
  - no gender
  - different predefined interests
  - varrying DOB
- Uses secret algorithm to gather data (obv)
- Spoke to company execs
- shares, likes, follows, what you watch
  - determined watch time as most important (only one needed)
- app tracks watch time, skips, rewatch, etc
- TikTok Experience
  - suggested popular videos (wide varriety shown)
  - based on initial responses/exploration it'll reccomend you similar videos
    - more niche with less views
- Learned bots' interests in less than 2 hours (sometimes less than 40 minutes)
- Guillaume Chaslot (Data scientist | Founder of Algotransparency) 
  - On YT more than 70% of the views come from recommendation engine
    - On TT its 90+%
