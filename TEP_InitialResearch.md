# TEP Initial Research Notes

### Topic: how does TikTokâ€™s data mining to improve its algorithm impact its users addiction to their platform 

## [Frontiers in Psychology Paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.932805)

**Why is this matter important?**
- The platform is huge and still growing
- Frontiers paper considers the algorithm the most advanced 
- The target audience is young adults and adolescents
  - 06-17 (31.59%)
  - 18-24 (30.14%)
  - 25-30 (20.85%)
  - 31-35 (8.66%)
  - 35+ (8.76%)
- The native and easily absorbed nature of young people 

**What does most research on the topic of social media addition fail to account for?**
  > The role of users' personal perception outside of psychological mechanisms (dopamine release)

**What does this study do differently?**
  > examines the effects of TikTok technical environment factors (information and system quality) and the impact this has on adolescents' inner perception  
  > adopts an extended version of the SOR model based on environmental psychology

**What is the SOR model?**
  - SOR Model: Stimulus Organism Response model
  - Proposes that **environmental stimulants** (S) work in conjunction to affect a **users'** (O) internal state to illicit some **response** (R)
  - **Stimulus:** Information/system quality  
      - **Information quality** refers to content and is measured in conciseness, subscription and usefulness. 
      - **System quality** is the application/algorithm and is measured in flexibility, integration, ease of use, and response time
  - **Organism:** The users' internal state of perception, feelings, and thinking composed of cognition and emotion 
    - **Cognition:** time distortion
    - **Emotion:** enjoyment/concentration/boredom/etc.
      - These were components of the online ***flow experience*** *(The inner feeling of enjoyment that encourages further participation)*
    - The heaviest weight (seemingly) is concentration
  - **Response:** Depicted as access/avoidance attitude or behavior generated from external environment (S) or internally from the user (O)

**(According to the paper) What was data was explicitly said to be mined?**
  > - Login method
  > - Network-associated personal info
  > - content of likes

**Keywords/phrases**
- Entertainment spiral
- Closed Loop relationship: between the addiction and algorithm optimization
- **Flow Experience:** an inner feeling of enjoyment, concentration, time distortion
  - Also found in the context of online gaming
- The (S) in SOR could refer to the layout or physical interface used (phone/tablet/desktop)

**Conclusions:** TikTok understands the advance nature of its algorithm and should impose some intermission system
to aid adolescents in managing their viewing time considering the lack of self-control they have.
Because TT weighs concentration heavily in their algorithm, ultimately leading to addiction, they could
*easily* implement this.
Alternatively they could recommend educational content.
TT should be a platform that looks to inform and educate just as much as it does entertain.
Parents and schools should take steps to decrease viewing time of adolescents.

- Labels it fastest growing social network
- 100 Automated bots used
  - no gender
  - different predefined interests
  - varying DOB
- Uses secret algorithm to gather data (obvious)
- Spoke to company execs
- shares, likes, follows, what you watch
  - determined watch time as most important (only one needed)
- app tracks watch time, skips, rewatch, etc.
- TikTok Experience
  - suggested popular videos (wide variety shown)
  - based on initial responses/exploration it'll recommend you similar videos
    - more niche with less views
- Learned bots' interests in less than 2 hours (sometimes less than 40 minutes)
- Guillaume Chaslot (Data scientist | Founder of Algotransparency) 
  - On YT more than 70% of the views come from recommendation engine
    - On TT its 90+% 
  - Similar to what we see on YT we see on TT
  - Users get *rabbit-holed* into a content spiral (echo chamber)
  - Despite being given a `Not Interested` button on videos, the algorithm seems to follow its own understanding of the user over what the user says

- **Investigation steps:**
  - kentucky_96 is a bot
    - interest: `sadness`
  - first `sadness` video found less than 3 min in (15th video)
    - stops scrolling and watches this video twice
  - things noted by TT (metadata)
    - Audio
    - Author of video
    - Description
    - Hashtags
  - 23 videos later another `sadness` video (4 more minutes of watching)
  - vid 57 repeated watch of heartbreak video
  - vid 60 emotional pain video
  - vid 80 (15 mins in) relationship video (scrolls away before finishing)
  - Pause with tag `#mentalhealth`
  - swipes quickly past videos about relationships
  - lingers over video with tag #depression and #anxiety

- **Analysis:**
  - 278 videos (36 minutes of watch time total)
  - 93% of videos being recommended are depression related
  - Using the `Not Interested` button wasn't enough to get a different feed
    - Changing viewing habits did

**TT's algorithm results in users regressing into the farthest corner of their niche**  
This could result a user who is exploring content of sadness through one video
to eventually being pushed into a rabbit-hole of content related to depression

**What is TikTok (TT)?**
  - Successor to Musical.ly app (Acquired by TT owner ByteDance)  
  - Approximately 1 Billion monthly active users

**Recommendation Engine**
  - `For You` page is curated content selected using TT's algorithm
  - Considers how both Instagram (IG) and TT weigh factors:
    - previous video interactions
    - accounts
    - hashtags
    - location
    - language preferences
    - user created content
  - TT opens with video recommendations (What the platform thinks you like)
  - IG opens with content from followed accounts (What the user thinks they like)
  - Claims TT using AI and data mining "practices" in their recommendation engine
  - TT openly claims it uses these factors (categorized) in a [blog](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you):
    - **User Interactions:**
      - videos watched
      - videos liked/shared/commented on
      - content created
    - **Video Info/details:**
      - Hashtags
      - Sounds
      - Captions
    - **Device and account settings\*:**
      - Device type
      - Language Preference
      - Country Setting  
      \*While these are used their weight is lower in how they influence the algorithm
      as these aren't factors the user actively expresses

  **Data Collected TikTok's [privacy policy]():**
